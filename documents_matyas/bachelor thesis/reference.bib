abstract={ The use of context is important in interactive applications. It is particularly
important for applications where the user’s context is changing rapidly,
such as in both handheld and ubiquitous computing. In order to better understand
how we can use context and facilitate the building of context-aware
applications, we need to more fully understand what constitutes a contextaware
application and what context is. Towards this goal, we have surveyed
existing work in context-aware computing. In this paper, we provide an overview
of the results of this survey and, in particular, definitions and categories of
context and context-aware. We conclude with recommendations for how this
better understanding of context inform a framework for the development of
context-aware applications.},}
