  abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk.},

abstract={ The use of context is important in interactive applications. It is particularly
important for applications where the user’s context is changing rapidly,
such as in both handheld and ubiquitous computing. In order to better understand
how we can use context and facilitate the building of context-aware
applications, we need to more fully understand what constitutes a contextaware
application and what context is. Towards this goal, we have surveyed
existing work in context-aware computing. In this paper, we provide an overview
of the results of this survey and, in particular, definitions and categories of
context and context-aware. We conclude with recommendations for how this
better understanding of context inform a framework for the development of
context-aware applications.},}
